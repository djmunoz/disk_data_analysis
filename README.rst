==================================================
.. sectnum::


Overview
--------

A Python package!

Installation
--------

You need to have git installed. In addition, you need the NumPy and SciPy Python packages.

.. code::
   
   git clone https://github.com/djmunoz/disk_data_analysis.git

   cd disk_data_analysis
   
   sudo python setup.py install

That is all!


Examples
--------


Reading-in data
~~~~~~~


Computing radial profiles
~~~~~~~


Mapping onto polar grids
~~~~~~~


.. code:: python
	  
   polar_grid =
   
   density_gridded = da.

Perhaps you would rather use an unevenly sampled grid loosely based
on the actual positioning of the cells/particles

.. code:: python
	  
   polar_grid =
   


Displaying 2-D fields without pre-computed image data
